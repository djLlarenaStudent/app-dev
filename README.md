# My Favorite Series
1. Land Of The Lustrous - a story set in a distant future where the Earth is inhabited by immortal, genderless beings called "Lustrous" who are essentially living gemstones, each with unique abilities and appearances based on different minerals; they must defend themselves against the Lunarians, who attack to harvest their bodies for decoration, with the young and fragile Phosphophyllite (nicknamed Phos) finding a unique role in this fight despite their limitations.
2. Firepunch - Fire Punch takes place on an Earth that has become frozen over and barren. The series follows Agni, a young man who is able to regenerate his body. After his village succumbs to inextinguishable flames he is left constantly on fire, leaving him in anguish and seeking revenge.
